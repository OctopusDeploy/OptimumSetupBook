Octopus are generally very hygenic animals that clean up after themselves.

Octopus

## Routine Maintenance

### Upgrade

It's key to keep Octopus up to date and there is a section which covers this in more detail but we are continually working to ensure Octopus performs to a high standard and we will always recommend upgrading to the latest version. 

> An example, many customers have saw reported speed improvements of their deployments after upgrading from earlier versions of Octopus **3.x** to the latest versions. 

### Retention Policies

Octopus are generally hygienic creatures, cleaning up after themselves, and your Octopus is no different. Configuration documents, like projects and environments, are stored until you delete them, unlike historical documents like releases. These will be cleaned up according to the retention policies you configure.

The one exception to this is the Events table which records an audit trail of every significant event in your Octopus.

A tighter retention policy means your Octopus Server will run faster across the board.
