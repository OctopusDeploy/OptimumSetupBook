# Introduction

Everyone who works at Octopus Deploy likes to think our product is super easy to use and set up.  Underneath the covers, Octopus Deploy is a complex product.  It was designed to help reinforce best deployment practices such as building artifacts once, using the same deployment process for each environment, and restricting access to production machines to name a few.  At the same time, Octopus Deploy offers you flexibility in how you meet your company's needs; however, that flexibility can be a double-edged sword.

The authors of this book focus on customer success at Octopus Deploy.  We meet with customers to ensure that they are getting the most out of Octopus Deploy. We discuss what is and isn't working for them and offer recommendations.  We have seen some _interesting_ configurations with Octopus Deploy.  In some cases, bad practices have been going on for so long that changing them takes quite a bit of effort, and that's what drove us to write this book.  We wanted to take all the lessons we've learned and share them with the community.

Our goal for this book is to help you set up Octopus Deploy to scale as soon as possible. Anytime you start learning something new; you go through a series of steps.  First, you start by learning the basics.  You create a proof of concept to see if it works for your basic needs.  After that, you move onto a pilot project or a pilot group and use it every day.  You remove short-cuts made early on, and your proof of concept becomes the working solution.  After that comes adoption, where everyone in the company starts using it. It's at this point, that a wrong configuration or two become standards.  Changing standards takes more time as usage grows.  It goes from being a one week project to a much longer project, stretching to months or even a year.

We are always improving the onboarding process.  Our documentation has great guides.  But those items give you "just the facts."  Imagine if the documentation prompted you every time you did something that is "not recommended."  That would get old very quickly.  The intended audience for this book have set up a proof of concept and would like some recommendations on configuration.  We want to help you make better decisions about your configuration so that Octopus Deploy can scale with your company.  We hope that anyone with Octopus Deploy experience, from beginners to experts, will gain something from this book.

We are going to take a fresh install of Octopus Deploy and configure it to scale in this book.  We are going to start at the very beginning, setting up your infrastructure, and then proceed to configuring environments, lifecycles, retention policies, projects, security, performance, and maintainability.  We wrote this book to be read from cover to cover, but you can pick your favorite topic and jump right in.  We don't believe anything we recommend will solve every possible scenario you run into in your day to day life, but we want you to use this as a starting guide to meet your needs.

Finally, this book does have a lot of overlap with our documentation and our onboarding process.  We are going to assume you have some familiarity with Octopus Deploy, that you know what a Tentacle is, and you know how to add steps to your deployment processes.  If none of these terms are familiar to you, or if this is your first time using Octopus Deploy, we recommend that you read our documentation and create a proof of concept using our onboarding process.
