# Introduction
Everyone who works at Octopus Deploy likes to think our product is super easy to use and is very easy to set up.  Underneath the covers, Octopus Deploy is a complex product.  It offers a lot of functionality.  It was designed to help reinforce best deployment practices such as building artifacts once, using the same deployment process for each environment, or restricting access to production machines to name a few.  While at the same time offering users such as yourself the flexibility so Octopus Deploy can meet your companies needs.  But that flexibility is a double-edged sword.  

All the authors of this book are focused on customer success at Octopus Deploy.  We meet with customers often to discuss what is working for them, what isnâ€™t working for them and offer recommendations.  We have seen...some interesting configurations with Octopus Deploy.  In some cases, bad practices have been going on for so long that changing them takes quite a bit of effort.  That is what drove us to write this book.  We wanted to take all those lessons we have learned and share them with the community.  This way we can help them help themselves.

Anytime you start learning something new you go through a series of steps.  First you start out learning the basics.  Typically a proof of concept is created to see if it works for your basic needs.  After that you move onto a pilot project or a pilot group and use it day to day.  Any short-cuts made during the proof of concept phase is removed and it slowly morphs into a working solution.  After that comes adoption, where everyone in the company starts using it.  This is where a bad configuration or two becomes a standard.  Changing standards takes a lot of time as usage grows.  It goes from one week, to one month, to a year-long project.  

Our UI team is always improving the on-boarding process.  Our documentation has a great getting started guide.  But those are targeted at people who are just starting with Octopus Deploy and might be working on a proof of concept.  The intended audience for this book are people who are in the middle of a pilot project using Octopus Deploy, are about to start expanding to the rest of the company, or would just like some tips on configuration recommendations.  Our goal of this book is to help you make better decisions on your configuration so Octopus Deploy can scale with your company.  That is not to say experts in Octopus Deploy won't gain anything from it.  

In this book we are going to take a fresh install of Octopus Deploy and configure it to scale.  We are going to start at the very start, setting up your infrastructure and proceed on with configuring environments, lifecycles, retention policies, projects, security, performance, and maintainability.  It is designed to be read from cover to cover or you can pick your favorite topic out and jump right to it.  We don't believe what we recommend will solve every possible scenario you run into in your day to day life.  Our goal is to provide you with recommendations which you can then adjust to meet your needs.

Finally, this book does have a lot of overlap with our getting started guide in the UI as well as our on-boarding process.  With that said, we are going to assume you have some familarity with Octopus Deploy.  We assume you know what a tentacle is and you know how to add steps into your deployment process.  If none of those terms are familiar to you or if this is your first time using Octopus Deploy we recommend you read our getting started guide and create a Proof of Concept using our on-boarding process.
